## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of STROMDAO infrastructure and the energy market ecosystem seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**
2. **Email the security team directly at [dev@stromdao.com](mailto:dev@stromdao.com)** with the subject line `SECURITY ISSUE: Willi-Mako Client SDK`.
3. Provide the following details:
   - A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code
   - Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots that help explain the issue
   - Your assessment of the severity (if possible)
   - Contact information so we can reach you for additional details

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and work with you on a remediation plan. You will be kept informed of progress and notified when a fix is available.

## Disclosure Policy

- We request that you **withhold public disclosure** of the vulnerability until a fix is released.
- Once a fix is published, we will credit researchers who responsibly reported the issue unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
- For critical vulnerabilities affecting broader STROMDAO systems, coordinated disclosure may be required—including communication with energy market partners and regulatory bodies.

## Scope

This policy applies to the contents of this repository and the published `@stromhaltig/willi-mako-client` npm package. If you uncover issues in other STROMDAO products or infrastructure, please still notify us; we will route the report to the appropriate team.

## Encryption Key

If you need to send encrypted communications, request our PGP public key via [dev@stromdao.com](mailto:dev@stromdao.com) and we will provide it securely.

## Thank You

We appreciate responsible security research and will make every effort to work cooperatively with researchers to keep the Willi-Mako ecosystem safe for all market participants.
