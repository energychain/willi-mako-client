## How Can I Contribute?

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- üêõ **Bug fixes**: Fix issues reported in GitHub Issues
- ‚ú® **New features**: Add new functionality to the SDK
- üìö **Documentation**: Improve or expand documentation
- üß™ **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- üé® **Code quality**: Refactoring, performance improvements
- üåç **Translations**: Help translate documentation (especially German ‚Üî English)
- üí° **Examples**: Add usage examples for different scenarios

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you're new to the project. These are typically:
- Well-defined tasks
- Lower complexity
- Good entry points for new contributors

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-123
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or changes

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add or update tests as needed
- Update documentation if you're changing APIs

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Type checking
npm run lint

# Build to ensure no compilation errors
npm run build
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our [commit message conventions](#commit-messages):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for artifact filtering"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use **TypeScript** for all source files
- Enable strict mode (`"strict": true` in tsconfig.json)
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs

### Code Formatting

We use consistent formatting across the codebase:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
export interface WilliMakoClientOptions {
  baseUrl?: string;
  token?: string | null;
}

// ‚ùå Bad
export interface WilliMakoClientOptions
{
    baseUrl?:string
    token?:string|null
}
```

### Documentation Standards

All public APIs must include JSDoc comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new artifact to store data snapshots.
 *
 * @param payload - Artifact creation request with content and metadata
 * @returns Promise resolving to the created artifact details
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * await client.createArtifact({
 *   sessionId: 'session-id',
 *   type: 'validation-report',
 *   name: 'report.json',
 *   mimeType: 'application/json',
 *   encoding: 'utf8',
 *   content: JSON.stringify(data)
 * });
 * ```
 */
public async createArtifact(payload: CreateArtifactRequest): Promise<CreateArtifactResponse> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Testing Standards

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

```typescript
it('throws a WilliMakoError on non-successful responses', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const fetchMock = vi.fn(async () =>
    new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'forbidden' }), {
      status: 403
    })
  );
  const client = new WilliMakoClient({ token: 'secret', fetch: fetchMock });

  // Act & Assert
  await expect(client.getToolJob('job-1')).rejects.toBeInstanceOf(WilliMakoError);
});
```

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config)
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### Examples

```
feat(client): add support for batch artifact creation

Add a new method `createArtifactBatch` that allows creating
multiple artifacts in a single API call.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(cli): handle timeout errors gracefully

Previously, timeout errors would crash the CLI. This change
catches timeout exceptions and displays a user-friendly message.

Fixes #456
```

```
docs: add examples for MSCONS processing

Added comprehensive examples showing how to process MSCONS
meter reading messages using the sandbox API.
```
